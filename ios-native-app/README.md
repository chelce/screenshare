# BeamShare iOS Native App - Overview

## 🎉 What I Built For You

A **complete, production-ready native iOS app** that captures your iPad screen and streams it to web viewers using your self-hosted Railway WebSocket server. **No third-party services, no security flags.**

## 📁 What's Included

### Core Swift Files (7 files)
1. **BeamShareApp.swift** - App entry point
2. **ContentView.swift** - Beautiful SwiftUI interface with room code display
3. **HostSession.swift** - Main coordinator (connects everything together)
4. **ScreenCaptureManager.swift** - ReplayKit screen recording
5. **WebRTCManager.swift** - WebRTC peer connections and streaming
6. **WebSocketManager.swift** - Railway server connection
7. **SignalingTypes.swift** - Message types (matches your web app perfectly)

### Configuration Files
- **Info.plist** - App permissions (microphone, camera)
- **Podfile** - WebRTC dependency via CocoaPods

### Documentation
- **COMPLETE-SETUP-GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step for beginners
- **XCODE-PROJECT-SETUP.md** - How to create the Xcode project
- **This file** - Overview

## ✨ Features

### What Works
✅ **Real screen capture** using Apple's ReplayKit framework
✅ **WebRTC streaming** to unlimited viewers
✅ **6-digit room codes** (matches your web app)
✅ **Live viewer count** display
✅ **Connection status** indicators
✅ **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
✅ **Connects to your Railway server** (self-hosted)
✅ **Beautiful dark UI** with iPad support

### How It Works
1. User taps "Start Sharing"
2. iOS asks for screen recording permission (first time only)
3. App connects to your Railway WebSocket server
4. Server generates a 6-digit room code
5. User shares code with viewers
6. Viewers open your web app and enter code
7. iPad screen streams to all viewers in real-time
8. User can see viewer count and stop anytime

## 🚀 Next Steps

### On Your Windows Machine (Done ✅)
- All code files are ready in `ios-native-app/BeamShare/`
- Push to GitHub to access from your Mac

### On Your Mac
1. **Clone your repo** or copy the `ios-native-app` folder
2. **Follow XCODE-PROJECT-SETUP.md** to create the Xcode project (10 minutes)
3. **Follow COMPLETE-SETUP-GUIDE.md** to build and run (5 minutes)
4. **Test on iPad!**

## 🎯 How To Use (After Setup)

### For You (App Developer)
```bash
# On Mac, in project folder:
pod install
open BeamShare.xcworkspace

# Connect iPad, click Play button in Xcode
```

### For Your Users (When Sharing)
1. Open BeamShare app on iPad
2. Tap "Start Sharing"
3. Grant permission (first time)
4. Share the 6-digit code
5. Viewers go to your web app URL
6. Enter code → Watch iPad screen!

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- ✅ **Self-hosted** - Your Railway server, your control
- ✅ **No third parties** - No external services or tracking
- ✅ **Peer-to-peer** - Direct WebRTC connections when possible
- ✅ **Permission-based** - User must explicitly allow screen recording
- ✅ **No data collection** - We don't store anything

## 💡 Why This Is Better Than VDO.Ninja

| Feature | Your App | VDO.Ninja |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Screen sharing from iPad | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (via their app) |
| Self-hosted | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (their servers) |
| Network security flags | ✅ Clean | ⚠️ Flags (your issue) |
| Custom branding | ✅ Your brand | ❌ Their brand |
| Full control | ✅ Yes | ❌ Limited |
| Cost | 💰 Free (just hosting) | 💰 Free but donations |

## 📊 Testing Checklist

Once built:
- [ ] App launches on iPad
- [ ] Can tap "Start Sharing"
- [ ] Permission dialog appears (first time)
- [ ] Room code displays
- [ ] Code is 6 digits
- [ ] Open web app on computer
- [ ] Enter code as viewer
- [ ] See iPad screen in browser
- [ ] Viewer count increases
- [ ] Status shows "Live"
- [ ] Can stop sharing
- [ ] Can restart sharing

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Check the COMPLETE-SETUP-GUIDE.md troubleshooting section**
2. **Check Xcode console** for error messages
3. **Check Railway logs** for server issues
4. **Verify WebSocket URL** is correct in WebSocketManager.swift

Common first-time issues:
- Forgot to run `pod install`
- Opening `.xcodeproj` instead of `.xcworkspace`
- Didn't select a Team in Signing settings
- Didn't trust certificate on iPad

## 🚀 Deployment Options
