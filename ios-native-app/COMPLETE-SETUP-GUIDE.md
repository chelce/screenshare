## ‚ùì Need Help?

Common beginner questions:

**"I don't see my iPad in Xcode"**
- Is it connected with a cable?
- Did you unlock it and trust the computer?
- Try unplugging and plugging back in

**"The app crashes immediately"**
- Check Xcode's console (bottom panel) for errors
- Make sure ReplayKit capability is enabled

**"No video showing up for viewers"**
- Check Railway server logs
- Make sure WebSocket URL is correct
- Test on the same WiFi network first

**"Can I test without an iPad?"**
- Yes! Use the iOS Simulator (but screen recording won't actually work)
- In Xcode device dropdown, choose "iPhone 15 Pro" or any simulator

Don't worry if this seems like a lot! Once Xcode is set up, it's literally just:
1. Plug in iPad
